## Indicator Parameters
The Super Trend Plus EA uses four instances of the Supertrend indicator, each with its own set of parameters:

- **Supertrend 1**: 
  - Volatility Multiplier: 3
  - Period: 10

- **Supertrend 2**: 
  - Volatility Multiplier: 3
  - Period: 12

- **Supertrend 3**: 
  - Volatility Multiplier: 2
  - Period: 11

- **Supertrend 4**: 
  - Volatility Multiplier: 1
  - Period: 10

## Initialization
In the `OnInit()` function, the Supertrend indicators are set up with the specified parameters. The number of decimal places for the indicator is set using `IndicatorSetInteger(INDICATOR_DIGITS, Digits)`, and the number of indicator levels to display is set using `IndicatorSetDouble(INDICATOR_LEVELS, 2)`.

Each Supertrend indicator is configured using `IndicatorSetDouble()` and `IndicatorSetInteger()`, specifying the volatility multiplier and period, respectively.

## Deinitialization
In the `OnDeinit()` function, the Supertrend indicators are released using `IndicatorRelease()` to clean up and free resources.

## Tick Function
In the `OnTick()` function, the Supertrend values are retrieved using `iCustom()`, passing the necessary parameters for each indicator. 

The code then checks if three Supertrends align in the same direction using the `supertrendAlignment` variable. If the alignment is true and the fourth Supertrend is also positive, the market is entered and the trading logic is executed.

## Start Function
In the `OnStart()` function, the EA starts trading and manages open positions. The specific trading and position management strategies are not included in this code.
